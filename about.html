      <div class="about">
        <p>
          Ovation is an indie musician recording indie music for indie fans.
          Independent music (often shortened to indie music or indie) is music
          produced independently from major commercial record labels or their
          subsidiaries, a process that may include an autonomous,
          do-it-yourself approach to recording and publishing. The term indie
          is sometimes also used to describe a genre (such as indie rock and
          indie pop); as a genre term, “indie” may include music that is not
          independently produced, and most independent music artists do not
          fall into a single, defined musical style or genre, and usually
          create music that can be categorized into other genres.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many acts choose to go from an independent label to a major label if
          given the opportunity, as major labels have considerably more power
          and financial means to promote and distribute product, thus
          increasing the chances of greater success. Some acts, however, may
          choose not to go to a major label if given the opportunity, as
          independence generally offers more freedom.
        </p>

        <p>
          Similarly, others may become independent label acts after having
          already experienced recording on a major label. Bradley Joseph asked
          to be let go from his major label deal with Narada/Virgin Records
          and subsequently became an independent artist. He says, “As an
          independent, business is a prime concern and can take over if not
          controlled. A lot of musicians don’t learn the business. You just
          have to be well-rounded in both areas. You have to understand
          publishing. You have to understand how you make money, what’s in
          demand, and what helps you make the most out of your talent. But
          some artists just want to be involved in the music and don’t like
          the added problems or have the personality to work with both”.
          Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick
          one that best suits their own needs and wants.
        </p>

        <p>
          A successful independent label with a strong musical reputation can
          be very appealing to a major label. Major labels look at independent
          labels to stay current with the ever-changing music scene.
